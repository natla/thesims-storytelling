      &nbsp; Innocence is the matriarch of the clan of the Woodland Elves. She is also the founder of the Kind
      Monstre Orphanage, a boarding house for young girls.
      Innocence is the long-lost mother of Daren, mother-in-law of Dagmar, and grandmother of Carol and
      Daren Jr. The evil tongues spread all kinds of rumors, but speculations aside, the real reason
      behind her losing touch with her only male child is still unknown.
