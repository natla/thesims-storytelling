# Symphony Garden (The Sims 3 Storytelling) blog

A storytelling blog dedicated to one of my favourite games of all time - The Sims 3.
The reasons I love it so much to this day are the open world and the story progression mode.
I have created quite a few characters in the game which you can meet in the blog.

Retro girly style, pastel colors.
